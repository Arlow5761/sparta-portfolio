## Challenges

One of the major difficulties of creating this website is writing the code to properly set up the position and layout of different elements within the website. Since I, as the creator, have little to no experience with web development, I haven't gotten used with how things are typically done yet, particularly on writing html and css. Even so, this project have been a beneficial learning experience that has helped me to grow further.
